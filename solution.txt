Please add your pseudocode to this file
/*
Pseudocode:
1. Create an empty array to store all substrings.
2. Loop through each character in the string (start index).
3. For each starting character: 

Create substrings by extending one character at a time to the right.
Add each substring to the array.

4. After all substrings are created, return the array.
*/


And a written explanation of your solution.

This function takes a string and returns all the possible consecutive substrings from it.
It uses two nested loops:
- The outer loop picks each character as a starting point.
- The inner loop builds all substrings that start from that point by extending to the right.

For example, with the string "abc":
- Start with "a", then build "a", "ab", "abc"
- Then "b" → "b", "bc"
- Then "c" → "c"

These are added to an array and returned at the end.

Time Complexity: O(n^2)
Because we use two nested loops that together process all combinations of start and end positions.
